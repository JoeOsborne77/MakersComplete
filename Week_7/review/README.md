#USER STORY 
- I work for a school reports company 
- We help teachers find out how their students did on tests 
- String with comma separated values with test results 
- Need program to create a report from the string
- 

#INPUT                            |  #OUTPUT 
 - "Green, Green, Red, Amber, Red"|  "Green: 2\nAmber: 1\nRed: 2"
 -  "Green"                       |  "Green: 1"
 - "Green, Red, Red, Amber, Red"  |  "Green: 1\nAmber: 1\nRed: 3"


#NOTES 
- Assume client doesn't know anything about how program works
- Ask more questions; 
  - edge cases 
  - what happens if purple
  - what happens if student name instead of grade
  - Need to account for rogue inputs 
- Make tests far more simple
- Put all examples in input / output table to make it crystal clear
